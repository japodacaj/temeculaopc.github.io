_"In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." Proverbs 3:6_

What does it mean to acknowledge God in all of our ways? I suppose it's something like what we find in the New Testament: “And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.” (Colossians 3:17), or "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:31). We are to live our lives as those who recognize that we belong to God--indeed, "in Him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28). We are not only made by Him, but we are made for Him. 

Do we live like that? Can all of our actions and interactions have the stamp of God's approval upon them? I doubt it. Instead, we habitually neglect God, fail to acknowledge Him, and go about things our own way. This leads to much trouble. Yet this verse tells us that if we were to honor God in all our ways of living, God will bless all our ways of living! On our own we will hit ditches and detours; with God we will have straight paths.

Let me leave you with the words of Puritan Thomas Manton for your reflection. He writes, "This life is not to be valued but as it yields opportunities to glorify God. We were not sent into the world to live for ourselves, but for God. Every morning we should revive the sense of this upon our hearts: This day I am going to live with God. When a Christian leaves home in the morning, he must remember he is at Christ's disposal; he is not to do as he pleases, but to be guided by rule, and for God's glory--not only in his duties or immediate conversation with God, but in his sports, business, and recreations. What is it to do things in the name of Christ, but to do them according to Christ's will and command? [After all,] we can do nothing without Him."
