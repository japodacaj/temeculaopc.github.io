_“To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth— Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance, to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.   The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.”
(Proverbs 1:2–7)_

The book of Proverbs can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming and disorienting. It seems like a mishmash of pithy aphorisms that oftentimes have seemingly very little to do with one another. We read some of the sayings and we are left scratching our heads wondering what in the world the author is trying to teach us. Because of this, we can likely default to thinking that it's just best to avoid such a book altogether.

The opening chapter challenges this notion, however. Here we find that Proverbs is not meant to confuse or confound, but to impart wisdom, instruction, and insight in the ways of God. We are told from the offset that if we are to give careful attention to these words we will increase in learning and obtain guidance. And with that in mind, Proverbs then gives us the simplest and yet the most profound saying in all its pages: The fear of the Lord is beginning of knowledge. Indeed, it is this one proverb that dictates all the rest. If we want some benefit from this book and the instructions that it gives, we must first bow before our Heavenly Father and recognize that all wisdom is found in Him. We are hopeless in knowledge apart from knowing Him. Thus if you know God today through Jesus Christ, you are no fool (though perhaps the world may say otherwise). No, you have actually unlocked the key to supreme and sublime knowledge. You have uncovered the secret to everlasting life!
