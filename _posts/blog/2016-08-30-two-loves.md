_“So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God" (Proverbs 2:16–17)._

You will recall from our study last week that in Proverbs 1 wisdom is personified as a female (1:20). So when speaking about this book we often refer to Lady Wisdom. Halfway through the second chapter, however, another woman is introduced--the "forbidden woman" or the "adulteress." She is crafty, alluring, and attractive. What hope does this young man have at resisting her tempting advances?

The struggle that is presented is one that we all relate to. We all must fight off the pull to follow Lady Sin. But how? By being passionately in love with Lady Wisdom! This is, of course, the surefire way to stave off adultery: by being so consumed in heart, soul, and mind with our spouse that we don't even have room in our brains to ponder another person. So to be in love with wisdom is to be shielded from sin and folly. And this better far, for unlike Lady Wisdom, Lady Sin lacks a covenantal relationship with God. So to be married to her is to be destined for destruction, while to be married to Lady Wisdom is to walk "the paths of life" (v. 19).
