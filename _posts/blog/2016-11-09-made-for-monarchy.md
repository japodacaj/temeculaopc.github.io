Today many of us likely woke up with a sense of unease or frustration or depression (I am writing this Monday before the election). In a sense, that is good and right. We are never to put our confidence in princes (Ps 146), and therefore no election should give us a sense of security. That would be to fool ourselves into thinking man is sovereign, and not God. But the truth is, of course, that God is sovereign--"He does whatever He pleases" (Psalm 115:3). And that means even this election is in His hands. Perhaps it is His design to bring us to such a low point that we have to look elsewhere for aid. Maybe His purpose is to get us to ask, "If man can't save us, who can?!" We are forced to look away from down here, and look up.

We would do well to remember that no matter what goes on in the corrupt and sinful political spheres of this world, we are citizens of another realm. And that realm is pure and perfect monarchy. We are subjects of King Jesus. Yes, even today. The government is on His shoulders, and we are in His hands. So we do not panic. We do not give in to despair. Why? Because His kingdom is still in charge. He is still ruling and reigning.

And so today I would challenge you not to fear, not complain, not to rejoice because you think our new president will solve our problems... rather, today (and everyday) I would call you to serve your King. Be faithful to Him and trust His great wisdom. Rest in the protection that He affords you. And herald abroad to all the world the good news of His kind, merciful, and just reign.
