title: The Call of Wisdom
---
_“Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.”_ (Proverbs 1:29–33 ESV)

In Proverbs 1:20-33, wisdom is given a personality. Solomon gives her a voice and depicts a scene of her crying in the market place, desperately trying to get people's attention and have them turn from their foolish ways and heed her instruction. It's a frustrating scene to envisage, because no one's listening. No one realizes how better off they would be by submitting to Lady Wisdom. "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?" (v. 22).

In this passage, we are given a foreshadowing of the ministry of Christ. Here the Divine Author has prepared us as readers to look forward to the person of Christ when we think of the attribute of wisdom. This scene of Wisdom crying out in the streets is very similar to that of Christ weeping over the fact Jerusalem did not listen to him: "And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, saying, “Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes." Or these words from John 8:37, "On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'" Like Lady Wisdom, Christ stands up and cries aloud with the promise of eternal prosperity to those who turn to Him. Have you answered His call? Have you recognized that in Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge? (Col 2:3).
