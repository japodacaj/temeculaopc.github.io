_“Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and forsake not your mother’s teaching, for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck. My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. If they say, 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason; like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder; throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse'— my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths, for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.”
(Proverbs 1:8–16)_

Wisdom doesn't drop out of heaven into our laps. It's something that must be pursued after and cultivated. Much like holiness, growing in wisdom should be a goal of the Christian life. This passage tells us that wisdom and understanding and discerning has a lot to do with the company you keep. God has placed certain people in our lives to help us in our journey toward godliness, while there are others who we must avoid lest we get stuck in the sand trap of stunting sin.

This section of Proverbs commends us to learn much from the godly parents we have been given. They are personified as crowning jewels. What a blessing that God loves to work in families! What a blessing that we have had (and perhaps still have) the opportunity to live under the same roof as men and women who have gone on before us and are qualified to impart wisdom that will be crucial to our growth as followers of Christ. Now, perhaps you have not had godly parents--this still applies to you. Because the point is that those who are younger in the faith must heed the instruction of those who are older, for mature Christians play the part of parents in the faith. This is God's tool for imparting wisdom: placing other dear saints of His in our lives that we may learn from them.

Conversely, we are told in these verses to flee the company of sinners, for "their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things" (Phil 3:19). This is difficult, of course, because their promise is that if you come along with them you will "find all precious goods." Perhaps earthly goods, but no lasting goods. "Fading is the worldlings' pleasure, all his boasted pomp and show. Lasting joys and solid treasures none but Zion's children know." The world will say it has the way to riches, but it is only the way of wisdom that is also the way of wealth.
