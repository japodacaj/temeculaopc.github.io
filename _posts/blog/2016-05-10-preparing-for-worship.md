title: Preparing for Worship 2

Last week we had the opportunity to explore some ways we can better prepare our hearts for Sabbath worship on Saturday.  This week I would like to offer just a few suggestions on how you can best give God the glory that He is due.

**Show up on time.**  Really, show up early!  Worship begins at 10, so it would be great to start making it a habit of showing up around 9:50 or so.  That way you can find your seat, get your things in order, and be ready to hear God’s call to worship when it comes to you.  Rushing in late is of course not conducive to calming and preparing our hearts for the Divine service.  In a sense, God ask so little of us, friends: an hour and a half once a week for worship. That’s it.  That’s six hours a month.  Studies show that we are very likely to sit in front of the TV or computer for that much time in a single day!  Surely we can show up in time to give God the full portion of the week he has required of us for corporate worship? 

**Sing out!**  God loves to hear our praise.  We may not, on the other hand.  Perhaps we are self-conscience because we think our singing voice isn’t up to snuff.  Well, let’s just be frank: it probably isn’t.  Neither is mine.  Who cares?  When we are preoccupied with these kinds of concerns we will mumble the words, mouth them, or just close the hymnbook all together.  This should not be so!  God is not glorified by mumbling, folks. John Wesley, in a 1761 hymnal, included a preface entitled: “Directions for Singing.”  Here’s an (abridged) portion of what he had to say: “Sing lustily and with good courage.  Beware of singing as if you were half dead, or half asleep; but lift up your voice with strength.  Be no more afraid of your voice now, nor more ashamed of its being heard, than when you sing the songs of the world!  Above all sing spiritually. Have an eye to God in every word you sing.  Aim at pleasing him more than yourself, or any other creature … So shall your singing be such as the Lord will approve of here, and reward when he cometh in the clouds of heaven.”

**Remember: it’s about God.**  We can often condition our minds to think that the worship service is supposed to meet our needs and tastes in some way.  We feel dissatisfied if we don’t “get something out of it.”  We grumble if the guest preacher is not to our liking, or the sermon didn’t have enough illustrations.  We don’t like the music.  We don’t like the building.  There are any number of things we can complain about!  But it’s not about our tastes or desires.  It’s about glorifying God with our heart, soul, and mind.  Before we even begin to discuss what we get out of the service, we must consider what we have put in to it.  Have we submitted ourselves to our Lord with all reverence and awe?  Have we laid aside our earthly cares so as to come hear from the Heavenly King?  You see, the wonderful thing is that when we make our aim to give to God, that is precisely when we will realize just how much we get out of worship. Therefore, when people ask, “How was church?” rather than responding with something like, “Great! We sang my favorite hymns!”  or, “Alright, the sermon was a little boring though,” we should train ourselves to say, “Wonderful—I met with God today at His table,” or, “I confessed my sins and was pardoned by Christ—how much better can it get than that?”


I am very much looking forward to being back this Sunday to bring God’s Word and worship with you.  Sunday really is the best day of the week! 

Your faithful Intern,
