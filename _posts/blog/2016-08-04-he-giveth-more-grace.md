In Matthew 9:1-8, when Jesus is brought the paralytic, He is moved with such compassion for the young man that He grants him the greatest gift that could ever be given: the forgiveness of sins.  Whatever earthly blessing we receive in this life, it will not compare with the spiritual blessing of the forgiveness of sins, of having a right relationship with God.  Now what gives Jesus the right to grant such a gift?  How is Jesus able to declare a pardon like this?  This is no doubt what was going on in the minds of the scribes (which Jesus was able to perceive – He knows our every thought!).  It was blasphemous for someone to declare such a thing without a commission from God.  They doubted Jesus had such a commission.

Jesus goes about proving otherwise through a beautiful illustration.  It is well known that Jesus is in the business of using verbal parables to teach lessons, but He also often does so through visual parables, or visible illustrations.  This one happened to be of life-changing consequence for the paralytic.  He poses the question to the scribes, “Which is easier to say: your sins are forgiven, or rise and walk?”  The obvious answer is “your sins are forgiven” – this is easier to say because it’s harder to disprove. On the other hand, if Jesus were to say “rise and walk” and the man did not get up, He would be exposed as the fraud and blasphemer they claimed Him to be.  So to prove that He had authority from God to both heal spiritually and physically, He raises the paralytic by the word of His power. 

Wouldn’t it be wonderful to have been the paralytic on that day!  How could it get any better than spiritual acceptance into God’s Kingdom, right? Well somehow it does get better. Jesus adds this cherry-on-top, so to speak. That is what it is like to follow after Christ, friends. He gives us more than we could ever imagine. He gives us grace, and then for good measure, He gives us some more (John1:16).  And why? To glorify God. This is how that passage ends: “When the crowds saw it … they glorified God.” May the greatness and goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ cause us to be filled with that same awe and wonder to glorify God in all that we do.
