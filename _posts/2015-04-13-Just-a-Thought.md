Happy Wednesday everyone!  I am writing to you—and hope to continue to do so in the months ahead—as a way of encouragement in your midweek pilgrimage.  My hope is that these “Wednesday words” may give us that extra needed “push” as we yearn to be reunited on Sunday around the means of grace.

 To that end, let me take a brief moment here to remind you of our Sunday evening worship service coming up this week.  This coming Sunday is particularly special because we have a time of fellowship afterwards (around 6:15) to enjoy coffee, snacks, musical offerings, and support one of our very own in an upcoming missions trip!  Another special aspect about this Sunday evening is that the elders have recently voted to introduce some slight changes into our evening liturgy.  This serves primarily to give variety between our AM and PM orders of worship.  The two main changes include some old (but new to us!) corporate prayers, and responsive readings through the Psalms.  The session is confident that, though small, these changes to our liturgical diet will serve in big ways to edify us and glorify God.

With a view to going through the book of Psalms in the Sunday evenings ahead of us, we might ask, “Why the Psalms?”  What makes the Psalms so important that they should receive such a privileged place in our worship?  Often times, the Psalms can seem obscure, outdated, or even irrelevant, so why should we say them today?  Aside from the fact that they are the Word of God, the Psalms are unique.  The Book of Psalms constitutes the church’s only inerrant and infallible hymnal and prayer book.  What do I mean by this?  In those 150 chapters found in the middle of our Bibles, God has given us His own Spirit-inspired words to express every human thought, emotion, and experience.  Put another way, the Psalms give us God-glorifying words to say and sing when all other words fail us.  Are you angry with God?  Cry out to Him, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?!” (Ps. 22).  Are you overwhelmed with gratitude?  Borrow from Psalm 118: “Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!”  Are you frightened or uncertain? Then pray to the Rock that is higher than you—your Strong Tower (Ps 61).  Are you overcome with guilt and don’t know what to do?  God has given you the answer in Psalm 51: ask him for a clean heart and a right spirit.

The beauty of the Psalms is that they don’t sugarcoat things, and God doesn’t either.  He recognizes our weakness, the trials we face, and the vast complexity of emotions that we call life.  He took them on himself, after all, in the person of His Son.  Jesus knows these words intimately because he knows their underlying emotions intimately as well.  “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin” (Heb 4:15). We have such a compassionate Savior, friends.  May that be an encouragement to you this week.  And may we be a congregation, along with psalmist, that delights in calling out to God in all of life, and meditating on His Word day and night.



Your faithful intern,

Jonathan
