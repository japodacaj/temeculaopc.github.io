Dear brothers and sisters, allow me to remind you today of the famous words from Ephesians 2:8-9—“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” What an important passage for us to saturate our hearts in day in and day out!  Herein lies the airtight argument for our utter dependence on Jesus for salvation.  A pastor once said in these verses are “the three nails in the coffin of self-justification:” we are saved 1) by grace 2) through faith 3) and not by works.  How often do your remind yourself of these facts?

When we remind ourselves that we are saved by grace, we call to mind the reality that we do not deserve to be saved.  Due to our sin we deserve quite the opposite.  Yet grace eclipses that.  Grace, manifested in the person of Jesus, is God’s immeasurable love to us.  We love because he firsts loved us, but God loves us because he loves us.  Not because we have done anything, simply because he loves us.

Along with that, remember that even the faith by which we receive grace isn’t our own – it too is a gift from God!  Our faith is infused in us by the power of the Holy Spirit. Sadly, many of us habitually revert to trying to win or earn our salvation.  When we do that, our good works are damning.  An old hymn urges us to “Cast your deadly ‘doing’ down, down at Jesus’ feet.  Stand in Him alone, gloriously complete.”  Does that mean that we are not to do good works?  Certainly not!  Paul addresses that very issue in verse 10.  We are created in Jesus to do good works, but we must never forget that they are not our works – they are God’s!  Every morning we should wake up and pray, “Lord, please lead me to the good works which you have established beforehand for me this day.”  It would be a good practice to remind ourselves that we are not saved by works, but we are saved to works.

In these verses Paul really wants us to see that salvation, from start to finish, is God’s doing.  When kept constantly before us, these words act as the antidote to the toxic haughtiness that can so easily creep into our hearts.  These “three nails” should drive our pride into the cross that we may humbly bow before Jesus.  After all, there is no other name, including our own, under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

Your faithful intern,
Jonathan
