### About Us

Providence is biblical, which means we believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are sufficient for our spiritual needs, clear to understand, and the final authority for how we ought to live in this life (2 Tim 3:16-17).  Therefore we are convinced that the Scriptures must be studied.  Above all, though, we believe that the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, points us to our gracious and merciful Savior Jesus Christ.  It is for this reason that we love studying the Bible.

Providence is confessional, which means we hold to the creeds and confessions of the Ancient and Reformed Church, as we believe they are an accurate and faithful summary of the teachings of Scripture.  As a congregation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, we hold to the Westminster Standards, which includes the Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms.  We appreciate other Reformed confessions as well, such as the Heidelberg Catechism.  Our creedal and confessional commitment unites us with the church universal, that is, saints down through the ages and around the world.

Providence is presbyterian, which means we are governed by a body of elders called by God and elected by the congregation.  Jesus, our Chief Shepherd, has appointed under-shepherds to care for His flock until He returns (Eph 4:11-14; 1 Pet 5:1-4).  Following the pattern of the Apostolic Church, we are united to other churches in a supportive and collaborative manner (Acts 15:1-4).  Our elders serve the denomination regionally through presbyteries and nationally through the annual General Assembly.
